## License 
Step 1 of Subglottic Stenosis Estimation pipeline (Keyframe Selection step) is released under AGPLv3 license.

## Pre-requisites
The software has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and uses Python. Required 3.X.

## Proposed Pipeline
Our proposed pipeline to estimate stenosis severity consists of two steps: 1) Segmentation, Tracking and Keyframe Selection 2) 3D Reconstruction and Stenosis Estimation. Stenosis is measured in step 2 at the keyframe selected by step 1.
